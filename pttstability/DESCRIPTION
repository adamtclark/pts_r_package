Description: Abbreviation for "ParTicle-Takens Stability". Includes a collection of functions
	that can be used to estimate the parameters of a stochastic state space model (i.e. a model where
	a time series is observed with error). The goal of this package is to estimate the variability
	around a deterministic process, both in terms of observation error - i.e. variability due to
	imperfect observations that does not influence system state - and in terms of process noise - i.e.
	stochastic variation in the actual state of the process. Unlike classical methods for estmiating
	variability, this package does not necesarilly assume that the deterministic state is fixed (i.e.
	a fixed-point equilibrium), meaning that variability around a dynamic trajectory can be estimated
	(e.g. stochastic fluctuations during predator-prey dynamics).
